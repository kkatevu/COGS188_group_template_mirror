    "# Project Description\n",
    "\n",
    "You have the choice of doing either (1) an AI solve a problem style project or (2) run a Special Topics class on a topic of your choice.  This repo is assuming you want to do (1).  If you want to do (2) you should fill out the Gradescope proposal for that instead of using this repo.\n",
    "\n",
    "You will design and execute a machine learning project. There are a few constraints on the nature of the allowed project. \n",
    "- The problem addressed will not be a \"toy problem\" or \"common training students problem\" like 8-Queens or a small Traveling Salesman Problem or similar\n",
    "- If its the kind of problem (e.g., RL) that interacts with a simulator or live task, then the problem will have a reasonably complex action space. For instance, a wupus world kind of thing with a 9x9 grid is definitely too small.  A simulated mountain car with a less complex 2-d road and simplified dynamics seems like a fairly low achievement level.  A more complex 3-d mountain car simulation with large extent and realistic dynamics, sure sounds great!\n",
    "- If its the kind of problem that uses a dataset, then the dataset will have >1k observations and >5 variables. I'd prefer more like >10k observations and >10 variables. A general rule is that if you have >100x more observations than variables, your solution will likely generalize a lot better. The goal of training an unsupervised machine learning model is to learn the underlying pattern in a dataset in order to generalize well to unseen data, so choosing a large dataset is very important.\n",
    "- The project must include some elements we talked about in the course\n",
    "- The project will include a model selection and/or feature selection component where you will be looking for the best setup to maximize the performance of your ML system.\n",
    "- You will evaluate the performance of your ML system using more than one appropriate metric\n",
    "- You will be writing a report describing and discussing these accomplishments\n",

    "# Background\n",
    "\n",
    "Battleship is a classic two-player strategy game that has captivated players of all ages for decades. The objective of the game is to strategically position your fleet of ships on a hidden grid and then guess the locations of your opponent's ships. Each player's grid is typically a 10x10 grid, and the fleet usually consists of ships of varying lengths. Players take turns calling out grid coordinates to attack their opponent's ships, and the first player to sink all of their opponent's ships wins the game.\n", 
    "The popularity of Battleship is not only due to its simplicity but also due to the deep strategic elements it incorporates. Players must balance between offensive and defensive tactics, making educated guesses based on limited information and adjusting their strategies as the game progresses. This blend of strategy, probability, and pattern recognition makes Battleship an ideal candidate for developing artificial intelligence (AI) to play the game effectively.\n",
    "There have been many AI  bots that can play an effective game of battleship. In a previous study that  trained an  using Q-learning and a linear model with an epsilon-greedy policy was tested on a 5x5 Battleship board over 100,000 episodes, with epsilon decaying to 0.01 to ensure sufficient exploration. Using stochastic gradient descent to minimize the Q function loss, initial tests with a fixed ship location confirmed the algorithm's effectiveness. For our problem, we want to look at a bigger board and implement reinforcement learning.\n"
