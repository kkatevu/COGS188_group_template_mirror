    "# Abstract \n",
    "\n",
    "The goal of this project is to develop an AI-powered bot for the classic game Battleship, aimed at enhancing strategic decision-making and gameplay efficiency. The data utilized includes a series of game states, representing the positions of ships and the sequence of moves made by both the AI and human players. These data points are measured in terms of hit or miss outcomes, ship placements, and the number of turns taken to achieve victory. The core of the project involves training the AI to predict optimal moves based on historical game data and employing reinforcement learning techniques to improve its strategy over time. The bot will be tested against both simulated and real human opponents to ensure a comprehensive evaluation. Performance and success will be measured by the AI’s win rate, the average number of moves required to win, and its ability to adapt to different strategies. This project aims to create a robust and intelligent Battleship bot capable of competing at a high level, providing both challenging and engaging gameplay for users."

    "# Background\n",
    "\n",
    "Battleship is a classic two-player strategy game that has captivated players of all ages for decades. The objective of the game is to strategically position your fleet of ships on a hidden grid and then guess the locations of your opponent's ships. Each player's grid is typically a 10x10 grid, and the fleet usually consists of ships of varying lengths. Players take turns calling out grid coordinates to attack their opponent's ships, and the first player to sink all of their opponent's ships wins the game.\n", 
    "\n",
    "The popularity of Battleship is not only due to its simplicity but also due to the deep strategic elements it incorporates. Players must balance between offensive and defensive tactics, making educated guesses based on limited information and adjusting their strategies as the game progresses. This blend of strategy, probability, and pattern recognition makes Battleship an ideal candidate for developing artificial intelligence (AI) to play the game effectively.\n",
    "\n",
    "There have been many previous researchers that have successfully programmed an AI modek that can play an effective game of battleship. Alessio Tamburro was able to do so he trained a model using [1](https://towardsdatascience.com/an-artificial-intelligence-learns-to-play-battleship-ebd2cf9adb01#0fbd) using Q-learning and a linear model with an epsilon-greedy policy. This was tested on a 5x5 Battleship board over 100,000 episodes, with epsilon decaying to 0.01 to ensure sufficient exploration. Using stochastic gradient descent to minimize the Q function loss, initial tests with a fixed ship location confirmed the algorithm's effectiveness. For our problem, we want to look at a bigger board and implement reinforcement learning.\n"

    "# Problem Statement\n",
    "\n",
    "The problem we aim to solve is the development of an advanced AI bot that can effectively compete against human players in an enhanced version of the Battleship game. This version features a larger 15x15 grid, which introduces increased complexity and requires more sophisticated strategies. The core challenge is to create an AI that can accurately predict the positions of the opponent's fleet and execute strategic maneuvers to efficiently sink their ships while minimizing the risk to its own fleet. It can be expressed in mathematical terms by optimizing search algorithms and strategic decision-making processes, measured through specific metrics such as the number of games won and average number of moves taken, and consistently reproduced under standardized game rules for thorough testing and validation.\n"
